          L2IG-WM: A partner in one of my businesses was becoming disengaged, not showing up for our meetings on time, not producing results
          on the projects she picked to work on in the business. We had a phone call where I brought up my concern that she was not
          as engaged as she had been in the past. She opened up, shared some anxieties about her life, the kind of work we were doing
          and how that connected with her memories from childhood. An authentic space opened up between us in our conversation,
          she felt heard and understood, and was able to reflect on what was most important to our business at that time and
          my understanding of how we would reach our goals. She started to believe we had a shot at achieving our goals.
          From there she cam up with a way for her to work on our marketing presence that supported not only her current needs in life,
          but supported our business goals. She ended up runing our YouTube channel for several months, producing 40 videos
          that have resulted in 10's of thousands of people viewing our content and getting exposed to our brand as a helpful
          source of information that would help them solve the kinds of problems our products are designed to solve.

          LeadTr&Auth: A junior engineer was not delivering on her promise to complete 6 points in our project tracker each sprint.
          I acknowledged that I had dropped the ball in an area that was adjacent to her work (not one I had promised to deliver on
          but an area that effected her). She was re-engaged as of that day went on an 8 week streak of producing
          at the highest level of her career.

          Software4Needs: In researching the business opportunities in the ABA field, I spoke with many disgruntled people who worked in the field.
          The each had a different set of issues they were most concerned with, parents not participating as needed, co-workers dropping the ball,
          insurance companies not following through, supervisors expecting impossible levels of performance.

          When I broke those issues down into core problems, I was able to see a trend of the work environment not supporting the work
          that needed to be done and therefore people not being able to perform at the levels they wanted to perform.

          When I summarized people's issues in this framework, they were overjoyed to hear someone understood their needs and were eager to
          help us build the kinds of tools we've designed to support their work and the results they want to have with their clients.

          L2IG-WM & LeadTr&Auth: The customer success team was under pressure to improve their speed to import data sets for new markets
          but their day-to-day productivity was slowed by multiple workarounds they were currently performing manually to have
          the application work as customers expected. Each week the product team would get several requests to change how the admin
          system worked, directly from the success team, so that they could improve their process. We would tackle one or two requests
          but they were piling up faster than we were completing them and they were not high priority for us. Management was
          not happy with the CS team's performance, and was activitely looking to replace people as the company depended on
          the CS team improving their throughput for upcoming expansions into new markets.

          I noticed each of the feature requestes were tied to a certain type of transaction from our customers.
          Could there be an approach that would solve several problems at the same time?
          By building relationships with the CS team and listening to how each individual got the different tasks completed,
          we were able to co-create an additional notification in their Slack channel that gave them everything they needed to know
          about each new issue, and gave them links to directly access filtered result sets in the admin system so they could resolve the issues
          with just a few clicks.

          The team's performance improved, the people who helped design the new message were happy with their ability to impact
          their work, and they were able to commit to the expansion plans the company was undertaking.

          Software4Needs: The data import team was slow on opening new markets.
          This hit at the core of our strategy and goals for the next 3 years.
          At the center of their work was building geo zones to allow list different products
          from different distributors per the geographical agreements those distributors had

          By getting to know some members of the team and understanding their confusion with the
          geo fencing math and the interfaces for it
          I was able to design a visualization tool to show how the math worked and
          make the admin interface link directly to what was happeneing behind the scenes

          The team loved the new interface and immediately improved their performance
          even before we implimented the feature.

          L2IG-WM: business partner was ready to pull out of our first fortune 500 sales opportunity because
          the actual users didn't understand the product.

          I worked with him to undderstand what was going on, what they were saying.
          Turns out, they didn't understand what the product was doing
          We designed a dashboard together that would allow them to see the internals enough
          to understand how it workeed and use it for themselves

          At the pitch the next day, the holdout users were sold about the new dashboard and we closed the deal!

          LeadTr&Auth: business partner was overwhelmed, not showing up to work, not productive.
          We had a lot to do, and customers who were taking advantage of our product.
          He had his head down in the day to day operations, didn't see that our progress
          was held back by being overwhelmed

          I was able to make space for his emotional state - which allowed him to
          have a fresh perspective on the business and work with me to build
          a process for the tasks that took up 80% of his work - so we could hire someone
          to operate those processes

          We hired a friend, who performed as well or better than my partner at the task
          and my partner was freed up to go after larger contracts.
          Resulting in our first sale to a fortune 500 business.

          Software4Needs: Or product was initially email based, our customers were interested
          but had trouble seeing how it would fit into their day to day workflows
          so they were not buying

          We researched their processes and watched them perform their work.
          I designed and built a google sheets integration that had the output
          of our system rendering directly into connected spreadsheets

          We ended up closing our first sale, and then three more in the
          several weeks following

          L2IG-WM: I started my tenure as team leader in the midst of
          several team members being unhappy about their commitments with the project
          People were not showing up to our phone calls, and not taking the early steps
          to accomplish the goals they were commited to

          I worked with the 6 people who had stepped into leadership positions
          in the team, spending time with them focused on their lives, their goals,
          their needs.

          The leadership team, and the teams each of them were leading
          started showing up to our meetings and started taking the needed steps
          to accomplish their goals
        `,
        `
          LeadTr&Auth: The team was disengaged, not bringing themselves to our shared commitments

          I opened up, shared my emotions about conflicts in my life, what was working
          and what was hard. I kept the emotional lines open between myselves
          and the team members.

          People got engaged, started sharing their own wins and fails.
          The leadership team, and the teams each of them were leading
          started performing at higher levels than they had in the prior year of
          working together.

        `
          Software4Needs: The team was disorganized and taking much longer than needed
          to communicate basic information. People were working hard but not much
          was getting done.

          I listened to some of the people I didn't know as well, people from different backgrounds
          than my own. I started to understand the trouble the spreadsheets we had created
          to keep track of our goals and our progress were casuing, they didn't understand
          spreadsheets, especially not complex sheets. I suggested we move our important communication
          to a new Slack instance. We could handle all of our organizations communication
          needs there, skipping emial and text messages
          and keep track of goals and progress there in text format, rather than spreadsheets

          People were immediately more engaged, communication overhead went down drastically
          and we performed in sync together and accomplished our goals.
